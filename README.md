# Big-mart-Sales-data-Analysis

in today’s world, Data Science finds a huge application in the field of Market analysis. Be it 
sales prices or the volatility of a crypto currency, prediction is the one thing that holds a
position of paramount importance in the field of marketing and trading. In this brief project, 
we have downloaded a very popular dataset – Big Mart Sales from Kaggle and have tried to 
fit an appropriate Machine Learning model that can provide us with an estimated price given 
several features about the item. 

The model with the best R2 fit and the least Mean Squared Error is picked to be the one that 
will be applied to the dataset. We then tune the hyperparameters a little and come up with 
a working application ready model. 

# Objective

The input dataset is an Excel file with information about sales of 8523 items sold at Big Mart. 
For each item sold, in addition to the price at which the item was sold, the dataset contains 
additional features such as the weight, MRP, the type, the year at which it was sold and 11 
such others. 

The steps we will go through are: 
1. Data pre-processing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Model training 
4. Model validation 
5. Model predictions 
6. Visualization of results

For accurate prediction of the Outlet sales price of a given item, we have used certain state-of-the-art regression algorithms like – Support Vector Machines, Linear Regression, Random 
Forest Regression and XGBoost Regression.
